## Traffic Analysis

Segmenting your traffic by source is a great place to start. Track these top five channels.

Organic: Those who have typed in a query and come to your site because it showed up on a search engine results page (SERP)
Direct: Those who typed in the URL to get directly to your site
Referral: Those who came from another website via link
Social: Those who were directed from social media to your site
Paid: Those that have clicked on a paid ad or promoted piece of content

Most of the time, companies are focused on bringing in organic traffic,<br/> 
hence the need for search engine optimization (SEO). But separating out your<br/> 
traffic by source can help identify other opportunities for your company, <br/>
like whether you should focus more on brand awareness or increasing social engagement.
