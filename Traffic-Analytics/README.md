## Traffic Analysis

Segmenting your traffic by source is a great place to start. Track these top five channels.

__Organic__: Those who have typed in a query and come to your site because it showed up on a search engine results page (SERP)<br/>
__Direct__: Those who typed in the URL to get directly to your site<br/>
__Referral__: Those who came from another website via link<br/>
__Social__: Those who were directed from social media to your site<br/>
__Paid__: Those that have clicked on a paid ad or promoted piece of content<br/>

Most of the time, companies are focused on bringing in organic traffic,<br/> 
hence the need for search engine optimization (SEO). But separating out your<br/> 
traffic by source can help identify other opportunities for your company, <br/>
like whether you should focus more on brand awareness or increasing social engagement.
